What is a WebElement?
Anything we see on the webpage is considered to be a webelement
e.g. buttons, dropdowns, textboxes, checkboxes

HTML?
HyperText Markup Language

What is DOM?
DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a browser's internal view of the webpage.
Also called Developer's tools
Document -- can be stored any document, like pdf, excel or word
Object -- any line inside HTML is called an Object
Model -- it is just a layout of the HTML file

Locator:
is a address or a position of a webelement in the webpage
is used to locate or identify a specific element on the webpage

8 Locators:
-- id
-- name
-- className
-- linkText
-- partialLinkText
-- xpath
-- cssSelector
-- tagName

HTML scripting meaning:
purple -- tags
brown -- attributes
blue -- attribute values

Why do we need many locators?
-- Developers may not provide all the locators for elements
-- Some locators might have duplicate values in the other nodes
-- Some locators may not be applicable to all the elements
        e.g. linkText and PartialLinkText are only used for links

"a" tag in HTML is called an anchor tag

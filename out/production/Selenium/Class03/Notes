Why do you think we need Xpath and Css?
1. Developers may not provide all the locators in the html
2. by using xpath and css we can identify elements with any given attribute

What is an Xpath?
xpath is like a query language which helps us to identify elements on uniquely on the web page

Types of Xpath:
1. Absolute xpath -- starts from the starting node in html
                     it always starts with single forward slash (/)
                     Example: /html/head/meta
2. Relative xpath -- starts from any node in the html
                     it starts with double forward slash (//)

Syntax for relative xpath:
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']

Example: //input[@id = 'twotabsearchtextbox']

Identifying element by xpath and using text:
//tagname[text() = 'text value']

Contains: will identify an element with a partial attribute value
//tagname[contains(@attribute, 'attribute value')]

Example: //input[contains(@placeholder, 'Phone')]
         //a[contains(text(), 'Forgot')]


Starts with: will identify the element with starting partial value
            //tagname[starts-with(@attribute, 'attribute value')]

Example: //h2[starts-with(text(), 'Connect')]
            //button[starts-with(@name, 'log')]

Ends-with was used in xpath 1.0, we are using xpath 2.0 and this method is disabled

<li> -- list
<ul> -- unordered list
<ol> -- ordered list
<div> -- division
<img> -- image
<p> -- paragraph
<h> -- header

Advanced xpath:
is based on parent and child, sibling relationships

identifying elements by following sibling
//tagName[@attribute='attribute value']/following-sibling::tagName
//input[@id = 'calFromDate']/following-sibling::img

identifying elements by preceding sibling
//tagName[@attribute='attribute value']/preceding-sibling::tagName
//span[text() = '& Orders']/preceding-sibling::span

identifying elements by its parent
//tagname[@attribute='attribute value']/parent::ParentTagName
//span[text() = '& Orders']/parent::a

identifying elements by its ancestor
//input[@id = 'email']/ancestor::form

identifying elements by its index
(//img[@class = 'ui-datepicker-trigger'])[2]

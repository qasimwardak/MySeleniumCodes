Alerts
Alert is a pop up message. Alert takes complete focus from the webpage we are working.
We cannot proceed further without handling an alert

3 types of alerts:
1. web based/ html alerts - we can simply inspect and perform action
2. Javascript alert/ browser alerts - we can handle it by using switchTo() method
3. Windows based alerts - we cannot handle with selenium

Types of JS Alerts:
1. simple alert - click ok
2. Confirmation alert - either cancel or click ok
3. Prompt alert - enter text and click ok

To handle JS alert we only have 4 methods available:
1. accept()
2. dismiss()
3. getText()
4. sendKeys()

Frames
Frame is a seperate and independent window in a webpage. Frames allow developers to present
multiple views in one webpage

3 ways to interact with frames:
1. by index
2. by name or id
3. by webelement

in alerts - switch manually and it switches back automatically
in frames - switch manually and switch back manually
